**Author**: Alexander Beers
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview
Ask Chef is a website that help users come up with ideas for meal choices and recipes based off the data input by the user. Data that the user can input to receive corresponding recipes will include a list of ingredients, answers to provided prompts, nutrient values, and more. Results can be saved to a customizable profile where they can be modified as desired.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
