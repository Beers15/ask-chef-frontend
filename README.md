## Overview
Ask Chef is a website that help users come up with ideas for meal choices and recipes based off the data input by the user. Data that the user can input to receive corresponding recipes will include a list of ingredients, answers to provided prompts, nutrient values, and more. Results can be saved to a customizable profile where they can be modified as desired.

## Architecture

Main libraries used: ReactJS, Axios, React-Bootstrap, auth0, react-flash-message, react-multi-carousel, react-tabs-redux

The [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) was used for all recipe resource data. The frontend for this site is hosted on Netlify.
